# Hypothesis Testing Phone Plan Revenues
Summary: In this project, a preliminary analysis of two plans offered by Megaline was done on a small client selection (500 Megaline clients) to determine which of the plans brings in more revenue in order to adjust the advertising budget. The data sets were explored, cleaned and merged. Data was visualized for understanding customer behavior in using the services and revenue distribution for the two plans.

Prompt: The telecom operator Megaline offers its clients two prepaid plans, Surf and Ultimate. The commercial department wants to know which of the plans brings in more revenue in order to adjust the advertising budget. This is a preliminary analysis of the plans based on a relatively small client selection (500 Megaline clients)

* megaline_internet.csv — mb used for each session
